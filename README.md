# Hacker House Tokyo üóº ü¶Ñ

## Overiew
- taka([@0xcommune](https://twitter.com/0xcommune)) and askyv([@0xaskyv](https://twitter.com/0xaskyv)) are hosting Hacker House in Tokyo.

- We gonna housing 12~(TBD) hackers and founders for free from April 13 - April 17 who will hack on open source public goods, on-chain experiments during ETH Tokyo. 

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª¬†Living and hacking together
- "Crypto" has become a buzzword in some circles, but let's think of it as "a new incentive layer added to the Internet". 
 Then we can literally reimagine everything. Now that we see how we can code, contract, and coordinate with the world, we can see everything in the world as hackable.

- The key word in this hacker house, in addition to the anarchic word "hack," is ‚Äúgradualism".

- Countries and companies have been around for a long time, but we believe the world needs to change dramatically when we can program trust with Ethereum. hack the future!

## ‚ùå What we are not:

- Because of the high demand for each house (~100-300 applicants and candidates per house), and because we are diverse by nature, we avoid hosting friends or people that we already knew or have hosted before.

- We also don‚Äôt like to host big parties and strive to keep the house an intimate place for small groups to hang out and have meaningful conversations.

- Hacker House does not provide team building assistance. Please apply to ETH Tokyo on your own. Even if you apply as a team, you will not be able to participate as a whole team (each team member will be screened one by one).
